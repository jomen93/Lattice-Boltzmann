A fluid is a continuous medium in space, such a medium is thought of as a composition of small point particles. Classical mechanics is a branch of physics that attempts to describe the behavior of bodies, whether they are solid, liquid or gaseous. It builds its mathematical formalism between experimentation and theory, in fluids it is about building a theory that serves as a model for a subset of real phenomena, due to the nature of the model, it renounces the claim of accuracy in the description and part of the fact. to reflect and allow us to intuit the underlying physical reality.

Fluids in the first approximation are described by the Euler equation, which in summary is to impose the conservation of mass, momentum and energy in the fluid, initially it is built considering that it is a reversible process, since energy losses are not assumed, Euler's equation is written
